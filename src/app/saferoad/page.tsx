        <p className="text-gray-300">
          SafeRoad is a React Native–based mobile application designed to
          improve traffic safety by providing real-time wildlife alerts for
          drivers. The app integrates geolocation, Firebase cloud services, and
          community-driven reporting, allowing users to share and receive
          information about moose and other large animal movements.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-300">
          Users can add sightings directly from the map, view nearby reports,
          and receive automatic push notifications when approaching active risk
          zones. The app also supports time-based analysis of sightings and
          hunting areas, helping visualize regional wildlife activity.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-300">
          The goal of SafeRoad is to introduce a data-driven perspective to
          traffic safety and encourage community collaboration at the
          intersection of nature and transportation.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">Project Background</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-300">
          In Finland, wildlife-related traffic accidents pose a significant
          safety risk. Moose collisions are especially common during dusk and
          nighttime hours. Finland’s vast forests and busy highways create ideal
          conditions for such accidents. Over the past five years, there have
          been on average nearly 13,300 wildlife collisions annually, with moose
          accounting for about 11.86% of them. These accidents cause serious
          injuries and substantial economic damage — the average societal cost
          of a single traffic accident is estimated at around €300,000.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-300">
          SafeRoad was created to combine community-driven wildlife reporting,
          reliable geospatial data, and intelligent notifications into a single
          mobile experience. The app visualizes where and when wildlife movement
          is most active, helping drivers make safer, more informed decisions on
          the road.

        <p className="text-gray-300">
          The system architecture is designed to be simple, modular, and
          scalable. The mobile app is built with React Native (Expo, TypeScript)
          and communicates with Firebase services in real time.

        <p className="text-gray-300">
          The project was implemented through iterative sprints: defining
          requirements and prototypes, navigation and map implementation,
          sightings flow, risk-zone logic and notifications, followed by testing
          and optimization. User experience and reliability were prioritized
          throughout the process.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-300">
          Technical decisions emphasized simplicity and stability. Expo reduced
          native configuration overhead, Firestore enabled real-time data sync,
          and Cloud Functions separated backend logic from the client. Risk
          zones are generated dynamically based on sighting density and time —
          once the threshold is reached, Firebase Cloud Messaging sends
          proximity-based alerts to nearby users.

          available only for iOS (EAS Build). Android support has not yet been

          transparently.

          I was responsible for the entire development process: requirements
          definition, UI/UX design, mobile implementation, Firebase
          architecture, risk-zone logic, push notification setup, testing, and
          final deployment. The project was documented as part of my Bachelor’s

        <p className="text-gray-300">
          Key learnings include advanced use of Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Cloud
          Functions, FCM), location handling in React Native, proximity-based
          notification logic, performance optimization, and delivering a
          production-ready UI using modern design principles. The project
          strengthened my ability to plan and build a complete, data-driven
          mobile application from concept to deployment.
